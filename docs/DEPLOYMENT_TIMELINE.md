### Peak Resource Requirements

- **Week 2**: 14 FTE (highest) - Test remediation sprint
- **Week 6**: 11.5 FTE - Marketplace + collaboration
- **Week 8**: 5 FTE (lowest) - Optional open source prep

### Resource Constraints

**Potential Bottlenecks**:
1. Backend engineers (19 FTE-weeks total) - most demanded
2. QA team (Week 1-2) - critical for deployment
3. Frontend engineers (Week 6-7) - marketplace + collaboration
4. Technical writer (Week 4) - documentation sprint

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Cross-training between backend/frontend teams
- Prioritize critical path items
- Use external contractors for documentation (if needed)
- Flexible Week 8 (optional phase)

| Week 4 | 5 days | 2 days | 7 days | 29% |
| Month 2 | ~25 days | ~3 days | 28 days | 11% |
| **Total** | **47 days** | **9 days** | **56 days** | **16%** |

### Contingency Plans

#### Scenario 1: Week 1 Deployment Failure
**Impact**: Critical (blocks all subsequent work)
**Contingency**:
1. Immediate rollback to previous version
2. Root cause analysis (4 hours)
3. Fix critical issues (8-16 hours)
4. Retry deployment (Day 8)
5. Extend Week 1 by 1-2 days
6. Adjust Week 2 schedule accordingly

**Buffer Available**: 1 day (Day 7)
**Extended Buffer**: Can push into Week 2 (up to 2 days)

---

#### Scenario 2: Week 2 Test Fixes Delayed
**Impact**: Medium (slows enhancement phase)
**Contingency**:
1. Prioritize P0 tests only (20-25 tests)
2. Defer P1/P2 tests to Week 3
3. Proceed to Week 3 with reduced scope
4. Parallel work on fixes + new features

**Buffer Available**: 1 day (Day 14)
**Mitigation**: Does not block Week 3 start

---

#### Scenario 3: Resource Unavailability
**Impact**: Varies (depends on role and timing)
**Contingency**:
1. Backend Engineer unavailable:
   - Reassign tasks to other backend engineers
   - Delay non-critical features
   - Use external contractor (if critical path)
2. QA Lead unavailable (Week 1):
   - Backup QA engineer takes lead role
   - Extend validation by 1 day if needed
3. ML Engineer unavailable (Week 3):
   - Defer vector embeddings to Week 4
   - Proceed with performance optimization

**Mitigation**: Backup assignments for all critical roles

---

#### Scenario 4: Performance Targets Not Met (Week 3)
**Impact**: Medium (feature quality affected)
**Contingency**:
1. Extend profiling by 1 day (Day 15-16)
2. Prioritize highest-impact optimizations
3. Defer lower-priority optimizations to Week 5
4. Accept partial improvement if >10% gain achieved
5. Plan further optimization for Month 2

**Buffer Available**: 2 days (Week 3 buffer)

---

#### Scenario 5: Month 2 Delays
**Impact**: Low (expansion phase, flexible)
**Contingency**:
1. Marketplace delayed:
   - Extend into Week 7 (3-day buffer)
   - Launch with reduced features (MVP)
   - Defer advanced features to Month 3
2. Collaboration delayed:
   - Defer to Month 3
   - Focus on marketplace + analytics
3. Open Source (Week 8):
   - Fully optional, can be deferred indefinitely

**Buffer Available**: 3 days (distributed across Month 2)
