## 1. Primary KPIs (P0 - Critical)

### KPI-P1: Coordination Efficiency

**Definition**: Measure of how effectively the system coordinates tasks across agents and modules without manual intervention.

**Formula**:
```
Coordination Efficiency = (Automated Decisions / Total Decisions) × Quality Factor

Where:
- Automated Decisions = Decisions made without human intervention
- Total Decisions = All coordination decisions
- Quality Factor = Success Rate of automated decisions
```

**Measurement**:
```yaml
baseline:
  value: 0.70 (70%)
  date: "2025-10-15"
  method: "Manual audit of 100 coordination decisions"

target:
  value: 0.95 (95%)
  improvement: "+25%"
  timeline: "End of Phase 4 (Week 8)"

measurement:
  frequency: "Daily"
  method: "Automated tracking in coordination logs"
  sample_size: "All coordination events"

calculation_example:
  scenario: "Deploy feature to production"
  total_decisions: 50
    - agent_selection: 10
    - task_decomposition: 8
    - resource_allocation: 12
    - quality_checks: 10
    - deployment_steps: 10

  automated: 47
  manual: 3 (human approvals required)

  success_rate: 0.98 (46/47 automated decisions succeeded)

  efficiency: (47/50) × 0.98 = 0.94 × 0.98 = 0.92 (92%)
```

**Milestones**:
```yaml
milestones:
  phase_1_end: 0.75 (+5%)
  phase_2_end: 0.85 (+15%)
  phase_3_end: 0.92 (+22%)
  phase_4_end: 0.95 (+25%)
```

**Dashboard Visualization**:

### KPI-P2: Pattern Reuse Rate

**Definition**: Percentage of tasks that successfully use learned patterns instead of planning from scratch.

**Formula**:
```
Pattern Reuse Rate = (Tasks Using Patterns / Total Tasks) × Pattern Success Rate

Where:
- Tasks Using Patterns = Tasks where pattern was retrieved and applied
- Total Tasks = All completed tasks
- Pattern Success Rate = Success rate when pattern was used
```

**Measurement**:
```yaml
baseline:
  value: 0.0 (0%)
  date: "2025-10-15"
  reason: "No pattern library exists yet"

target:
  value: 0.80 (80%)
  improvement: "+80%"
  timeline: "End of Phase 4 (Week 8)"

measurement:
  frequency: "Real-time"
  method: "Pattern retrieval logs + task outcome tracking"
  data_points:
    - pattern_retrieval_attempted: boolean
    - pattern_found: boolean
    - pattern_applied: boolean
    - pattern_success: boolean

  pattern_usage:
    - pattern_retrieved: 165
    - pattern_found: 150
    - pattern_applied: 145
    - pattern_succeeded: 130

  reuse_rate: (145/200) × (130/145)
              = 0.725 × 0.897
              = 0.65 (65%)
```

**Pattern Library Growth**:
```yaml
growth_targets:
  phase_1_end: 50 patterns
  phase_2_end: 200 patterns
  phase_3_end: 500 patterns
  phase_4_end: 800+ patterns

### KPI-P3: Task Completion Speed

**Definition**: Average time to complete tasks compared to baseline, accounting for task complexity.

Complexity-Adjusted Speed = Speed Improvement / Complexity Factor

Where:

- Current Time = Post-integration average completion time
- Complexity Factor = Task complexity rating (1.0 - 3.0)
```

**Measurement**:
```yaml
baseline:
  simple_tasks: "15 minutes average"
  medium_tasks: "2 hours average"
  complex_tasks: "8 hours average"
  weighted_average: "3.5 hours"

target:
  improvement: "+60% faster"
  simple_tasks: "6 minutes (-60%)"
  medium_tasks: "48 minutes (-60%)"

    - task_completed_at: timestamp
    - task_complexity: 1.0-3.0
    - pattern_used: boolean
    - replanning_count: integer

calculation_example:
  task_type: "API endpoint implementation"
  complexity: 2.0 (medium)
  baseline_time: 120 minutes
  current_time: 45 minutes

  raw_improvement: (120 - 45) / 120 = 0.625 (62.5%)
  adjusted: 0.625 / 2.0 = 0.3125 (31.25% adjusted)

  # Pattern used: Yes
  # Replanning: 0 times
```

**Speed Factors**:
```yaml
factors_influencing_speed:
  positive:
    - pattern_reuse: "+40-70% speed"
    - learned_heuristics: "+20-30% speed"
    - reduced_replanning: "+10-20% speed"
    - agent_learning: "+15-25% speed"

  negative:
    - neural_overhead: "-5-10% speed initially"
