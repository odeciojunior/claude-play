## 1. Critical Risks

### Risk C1: Neural System Complexity Overrun

**Category**: Technical
**Probability**: Medium (40%)
**Impact**: Critical (4+ week delay)
**Risk Score**: 8/10

**Description**:
The SAFLA neural engine is the most complex component. Implementation may take significantly longer than the 40-hour estimate due to:
- Unforeseen algorithmic challenges
- Performance optimization difficulties
- Integration complexities with SQLite
- Memory management issues
- Feedback loop convergence problems

**Potential Impact**:
- 4-8 week delay in Phase 1
- Blocks all subsequent work
- Team demoralization
- Budget overrun by 50%+
- May require architecture redesign

**Mitigation Strategy**:

```yaml
mitigation:
  prevention:
    - action: "Create detailed prototype in first week"
      timeline: "Week 1, Days 1-3"
      owner: "Neural Specialist"
      deliverable: "Working prototype with core functionality"

    - action: "Implement in vertical slices"
      approach: "Build one memory tier completely before others"
      benefit: "Early validation, incremental progress"

    - action: "Set checkpoint gates"
      checkpoints:
        - day_3: "Vector memory working"
        - day_5: "Two memory tiers integrated"
        - day_7: "All tiers communicating"
        - day_10: "Feedback loops functional"

    - action: "Buffer time allocation"
      estimate: "40 hours"
      buffer: "20 hours (50%)"
      total: "60 hours"
      justification: "First-of-kind implementation"

  detection:
    - metric: "Daily progress tracking against checkpoints"
    - trigger: "More than 1 day behind schedule"
    - alert: "Notify project lead immediately"

  response:
    - if_behind_1_day: "Add pairing support, extend daily hours"
    - if_behind_2_days: "Activate contingency team member"
    - if_behind_3_days: "Consider architecture simplification"
    - if_behind_5_days: "Trigger replanning, possibly use existing neural library"

  fallback:
    - option: "Use existing neural framework (TensorFlow/PyTorch)"
    - trade_off: "Less custom, but proven and faster"
    - decision_point: "End of Week 1"
```

**Contingency Plan**:
If progress is severely behind by end of Week 1:
1. Evaluate existing neural libraries for 80% solution
2. Reduce SAFLA to MVP (2 memory tiers instead of 4)
3. Accept lower initial performance, optimize in Phase 4
4. Add 2 weeks to project timeline

**Current Status**: MONITORING
**Next Review**: Week 1, Day 3

## 6. Risk Management Process

### 6.1 Continuous Monitoring

```yaml
monitoring_cadence:
  daily:
    - check_critical_risks: "C1, C2, C3"
    - review_metrics: "Performance, progress"

  weekly:
    - risk_review_meeting: "All risks"
    - update_risk_status: "Current state"
    - adjust_mitigation: "If needed"

  phase_end:
    - comprehensive_review: "All risks"
    - lessons_learned: "Update strategies"
    - next_phase_planning: "Anticipate new risks"
```

### 6.2 Escalation Protocol

```yaml
escalation:
  level_1_team:
    - trigger: "Medium risk materializes"
    - response: "Team handles with existing mitigation"

  level_2_lead:
    - trigger: "High risk materializes or medium risk escalates"
    - response: "Project lead activates contingency"

  level_3_stakeholder:
    - trigger: "Critical risk materializes"
    - response: "Stakeholder decision on scope/timeline"

  level_4_executive:
    - trigger: "Project viability threatened"
    - response: "Executive decision on project continuation"
```

## 7. Success Criteria

**Risk Management Success**:
- No critical risks materialized
- All high risks mitigated before impact
- Medium risks managed within acceptable bounds
- Project delivered within 20% of estimate (10 weeks vs 8 weeks)
- No catastrophic failures requiring full rollback
- All data preserved (0% loss)
- Team morale maintained (>7/10)
