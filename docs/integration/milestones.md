#### R - Refinement (Week 2, Days 1-4)
**Duration**: 32 hours (TDD implementation)
**Owner**: Neural Specialist + Developers

**Test-Driven Development Cycle**:
```gherkin
# Feature: SAFLA Neural Engine Core

Scenario: Store and retrieve a simple pattern
  Given the neural engine is initialized
  When I store a pattern with context "user_authentication"
  And the pattern has action sequence [login, validate, session]
  Then the pattern should be stored in all four memory tiers
  And I should receive a valid pattern ID
  When I retrieve patterns for context "user_authentication"
  Then the stored pattern should be in the results
  And retrieval time should be <100ms

Scenario: Learning from successful feedback
  Given a stored pattern with ID "pattern-123"
  And the pattern has initial confidence 0.70
  When I provide positive feedback with success_score 0.95
  Then the pattern confidence should increase
  And the pattern should be reinforced in semantic memory
  And the learning episode should be recorded

Scenario: Multi-tier memory coherence
  Given I store a pattern about "API endpoint design"
  Then vector_memory should have the embedding
  And episodic_memory should have the timestamp
  And semantic_memory should have extracted knowledge
  And working_memory should have cached the pattern

Scenario: Performance under load
  Given the neural engine is initialized
  When I store 1000 patterns concurrently
  Then all patterns should be persisted
  And average storage time should be <50ms
  And memory usage should be <500MB
  And no data corruption should occur

Scenario: Feedback loop meta-learning
  Given 10 patterns in the "deployment" category
  When 8 patterns receive positive feedback
  And 2 patterns receive negative feedback
  Then the system should identify "deployment" as reliable
  And future "deployment" patterns should have higher confidence
  And the system should improve prediction accuracy
```

**TDD Cycle**:
1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimum code to pass
3. Refactor for quality
4. Repeat for each feature

**Validation**:
- All tests passing (>90% coverage)
- Code review completed
- Performance benchmarks met
- No critical issues
