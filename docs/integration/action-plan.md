## 1. GOAP Methodology Overview

### 1.1 State Space Representation

```javascript
// Current State (Initial)
const S₀ = {
  neural_system: "not_implemented",
  verification_learning: false,
  goap_pattern_based: false,
  sparc_learning: false,
  memory_unified: false,
  agents_learning: 0,  // 0 of 78
  coordination_efficiency: 0.70,
  pattern_reuse: 0.0,
  adaptive_replanning: false
};

// Goal State (Target)
const S_goal = {
  neural_system: "active",
  verification_learning: true,
  goap_pattern_based: true,
  sparc_learning: true,
  memory_unified: true,
  agents_learning: 78,  // All agents
  coordination_efficiency: 0.95,
  pattern_reuse: 0.80,
  adaptive_replanning: true
};
```

### 1.2 A* Search Parameters

**Heuristic Function** (h):
```javascript
h(state) = Σ [weight_i × gap_i] for all gaps

Weights:
- neural_system: 10 (foundation blocker)
- memory_unified: 8 (enables sharing)
- goap_pattern_based: 7 (core capability)
- verification_learning: 6 (quality feedback)
- sparc_learning: 5 (methodology)
- agents_learning: 4 × (78 - current) / 78
- coordination_efficiency: 3 × (0.95 - current)
- pattern_reuse: 3 × (0.80 - current)
- adaptive_replanning: 2
```

**Cost Function** (g):
```javascript
g(action) = development_hours + risk_factor × complexity

Risk Factors:
- Low: 1.0x
- Medium: 1.5x
- High: 2.0x
- Critical: 3.0x
```

**Path Evaluation**:
```javascript
f(node) = g(node) + h(node)

// A* selects action with minimum f(node)
// Guarantees optimal solution if heuristic is admissible
```

---

## 5. Rollback & Recovery

### 5.1 Checkpoint Strategy

Each action has rollback capability:

```yaml
rollback_points:
  after_A1:
    state_backup: ".swarm/backups/checkpoint_A1.db"
    can_rollback_to: "S₀"
    data_loss: "minimal"

  after_A2:
    state_backup: ".swarm/backups/checkpoint_A2.db"
    can_rollback_to: "after_A1"
    data_loss: "none"

  # ... checkpoints for each action

  after_A10:
    state_backup: ".swarm/backups/checkpoint_production.db"
    can_rollback_to: "any_previous"
    data_loss: "none"
```

### 5.2 Failure Recovery

```yaml
if action_fails:
  1. Stop execution
  2. Analyze failure cause
  3. Determine recovery strategy:
     - Quick fix: Apply fix and retry
     - Rollback: Revert to previous checkpoint
     - Replan: Use A* to find alternative path
  4. Update action costs based on learning
  5. Continue or abort based on impact
```

---

## 6. Success Validation

### 6.1 Action-Level Validation

Each action must pass validation before marking complete:

```yaml
validation_criteria:
  A1: "neural_system === 'active' && ops_per_sec > 10000"
  A2: "memory_unified === true && migration_success === 100%"
  A3: "verification_learning === true && prediction_accuracy > 0.80"
  A4: "goap_pattern_based === true && speed_improvement > 0.50"
  A5: "agents_learning >= 10 && all_passing_tests === true"
  A6: "sparc_learning === true && improvement > 0.10"
  A7: "hive_distributed_learning === true && consensus_working === true"
  A8: "agents_learning === 78 && all_categories_enabled === true"
  A9: "adaptive_replanning === true && intervention_rate < 0.10"
  A10: "coordination_efficiency >= 0.95 && pattern_reuse >= 0.80"
```

### 6.2 Goal State Verification

Final validation against goal state:

```javascript
function validateGoalState(current) {
  return {
    neural_system: current.neural_system === "active",
    verification_learning: current.verification_learning === true,
    goap_pattern_based: current.goap_pattern_based === true,
    sparc_learning: current.sparc_learning === true,
    memory_unified: current.memory_unified === true,
    agents_learning: current.agents_learning === 78,
    coordination_efficiency: current.coordination_efficiency >= 0.95,
    pattern_reuse: current.pattern_reuse >= 0.80,
    adaptive_replanning: current.adaptive_replanning === true
  };
}

// All values must be true for success
```

## 7. Continuous Improvement

### 7.1 Learning from Execution

The GOAP planner learns from execution:

```yaml
after_each_action:
  - record_actual_cost: "Compare estimated vs actual hours"
  - record_actual_effects: "Verify predicted effects achieved"
  - update_heuristic: "Improve h(state) for future planning"
  - store_pattern: "Save successful action sequences"
  - adjust_risk_factors: "Update based on actual complexity"

meta_learning:
  - pattern: "If A1 took longer, adjust similar actions"
  - pattern: "If parallel execution worked well, prefer it"
  - pattern: "If certain dependencies were wrong, fix model"
```

### 7.2 Adaptive Replanning Triggers

```yaml
replan_triggers:
  - action_failure: "Action didn't achieve expected effects"
  - excessive_cost: "Action took >150% estimated time"
  - new_requirements: "Goal state changed"
  - better_path_found: "Discovered more optimal sequence"
  - resource_unavailable: "Planned resources not available"

replanning_strategy:
  1. Update current state
  2. Recalculate heuristic
  3. Run A* from current position
  4. Compare new path cost
  5. Switch if improvement > 20%
```
