## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **E2E Tests**: Not fully implemented (planned for Phase 3)
2. **Visual Regression**: Not included (UI components minimal)
3. **Cross-Browser**: Not applicable (Node.js backend)
4. **Mobile Testing**: Not applicable

### Future Enhancements

1. Add mutation testing for test quality validation
2. Expand performance tests to 24-hour endurance runs
3. Add fuzzing tests for edge case discovery
4. Implement chaos engineering tests
5. Add contract testing for API boundaries
